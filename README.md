# music-broadcast (Live music broadcast)

A live music broadcast application. The inspiration behind this project was to create a platform for sharing music that I am listening to in near real time with friends and family.

### Features:
    - Traverse through your music directory and play them one-by-one
    - The same sound track can be streamed online by hitting a certain endpoint
    - Only one music track can be played and streamed at a time
    
### Work in Progress:
    - Build a UI client to make the experience much more fluid

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable
> as possible. The idea is that a
> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.

This text you see here is *actually* written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.
