# music-broadcast (Live music broadcast)

A live music broadcast application. The inspiration behind this project was to create a platform for sharing music that I am listening to in near real time with friends and family.

### Features:
    - Traverse through your music directory and play them one-by-one
    - The same sound track can be streamed online by hitting a certain endpoint
    - Only one music track can be played and streamed at a time
    
### Work in Progress:
    - Build a UI client to make the experience much more fluid
    - I *may* extract a library out of this project in future

### Tech
